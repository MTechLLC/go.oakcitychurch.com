											<div class="text-justify">
												<p>
													In early 2017, SuNica plans to begin construction of a Recreation Center in the community of El Limonal in Chinandega, Nicaragua.
												</p>
												<p>
													This is a community where SuNica has been at work since 2010. Even as the kids that they serve begin to believe the gospel they are still faced with a systemic evil that is constantly working against a full and abundant life. This rec center would be the first building of it’s kind in this community. It will be a place where the kids of El Limonal can come every day to play in a safe environment, hear the gospel over and over again, and be encouraged to live it out in their local context.

													Dynamic Water seeks to change lives by providing local access to clean water to communities in need.  Dynamic Water’s founder, Shannon Smith, a member of Oak City Church, was motivated by his faith to help meet the physical needs of the extreme poor.  Dynamic Water partners with in country organizations, who have clean water as a part of their mission.  Then, advocates for and helps fund projects through those organizations.
												</p>
												<p>
													Through Oak City Go, Dynamic Water will help fund a clean water project in San Carlos, Nicaragua and will fund multiple projects in Orissa, India.  These projects will provide clean water to the communities to meet their physical needs and will provide SuNica and GHI a better opportunity to introduce the communities to the Living Water.

												<p>
													In 2016, GHI started a small business training program and micro finance fund for pastors that are struggling to provide for their family while serving in the village church. The program equips and funds the pastor to start a small family-operated business, allowing them to not only continue to work as a pastor, but also provide financially for their family. Through Oak City Go, GHI will fund twenty more startup businesses in rural Orissa.

							Quietly and slowly, in the back of the crowd of around thirty, she made her way to her feet. She was tall and lean.  Though older, she did not seem frail.  She had a air of dignity.  As she spoke, everyone listened intently.  We all showed due respect to one of the oldest in their church.
						</p>
						<p>
							"Everyone calls me 'Mama' and I am born again," she began slowly, starting with a profession of her faith, as so many others had that afternoon.  "Ten years ago, we started praying that God would raise someone up to help us serve the Rendille people.  That someone would be able to help us bring them clean water."
						</p>
						
						<p>
							It was October 2013.  Daniel Smith and I were in Kenya at the Christian Missions Fellowship Church in Kayole, Nairobi.  We had come to Kenya on behalf of Dynamic Water to finalize the details of our first project, a partnership with CMF to provide a local access to clean water in Laisamis, a village in the desert of Northern Kenya.
						</p>
						<p>
							Six years earlier, we had felt God leading our family to invest our time and talents into serving the desperately poor.  A year later, we crossed paths with the founder of the CMF church and made a commitment to help him fulfill the mission his church was on to reach the Rendille tribe with the Gospel.  It was out of this partnership that Dynamic Water began.
						</p>
						<p>
							Though based in an impoverished urban community, the CMF church felt lead to send out missionaries to an identified unreached people group.  They began serving the Rendille tribe in Laisamis in 2002.  Since, they had planted a church, started a preschool, and become a distribution point for government relief food.  They had been unable to meet the number one physical need, access to clean water, due to the cost.  In that situation, they prayed.
						</p>
						<p>
							In 2003, the CMF church began to pray for God’s provision.  Five years later, He directed our path to intersect with Dr. Joseph Wamititu’s.  In 2012, God provided clean water at CMF’s first church in Laisamis through the Kenyan government.  In 2014, Dynamic Water was able to complete our project four miles from the original location, nearby 1,500 other members of the Rendille tribe.
						</p>
						<p>
							Today, there is a second church in Laisamis, where the Good News of Jesus is preached in word and deed.  They are receiving the Living Water and physical water because men and women across the globe heard and responded to the call God had placed on their lives; some to go, some to give, others to pray, but all to participate.

							The shadow cast by the newly constructed water tower gave little reprieve from the heat that day.  Even as the temperatures soared past ninety degrees, over one hundred members of the community gathered to witness and participate in the celebration.  The repressive heat could not hold back the joy, as for the first time, the water would be turned on in El Porvenir, Nicaragua.
						</p>
						<p>
							Community leaders spoke.  Children danced.  A pastor prayed and preached.  Also, a group of children, led by a confident 13-year old, young teenage girl, put on a drama.  They told the story of their need for clean water and the celebrated the completion of the project.  Fatima closed the drama by thanking God for providing the community with clean water.

							This is fitting as the water tank is labeled Ebenezer in reference to a story the Bible in 1 Samuel 7.  In the story, to commemorate a great thing God had done, Samuel set up an altar and called it Ebenezer.
						</p>
						<p>
							Later, we spoke with Fatima.  Fatima shared how every morning she wakes up early to line up at the existing shallow well to collect several gallons of unclean water.  "The lines are long," she said.  "Sometimes I have to wait up to three hours."
						</p>
						<p>
							Most people go to collect their water for the day early in the morning, around six, because later in the day, the temperatures are very high.  The heat impacts those carrying the water back to their homes and the water itself, as the water from the shallow, contaminated well comes out hot in the afternoon, we were told.
						</p>
						<p>
							With the completion of the clean water project, families in El Porvenir will have access at their homes to abundant, clean water.  No longer will young girls, like Fatima, spend hours every day working to provide this basic need for their families.  Now, girls like Fatima can spend that reclaimed time discovering the talents and passions that God has made them with.
						</p>
						<p>
							Fatima, an emerging, young leader, can now go to school and develop the talents she’s been given.  She is now more free to grow into the woman God desires her to be.  Now that she is not working to survive, she can start to live and live abundantly.

							Kener and Jacson (two of SuNica’s more rough-around-the-edges sponsored kids) were throwing mangos at each other behind the school building after they were told not to. Classic. Naturally this tomfoolery led to a broken window, and one of our staff members, Darwing, confronted Kener (the alleged culprit). Surprisingly, Jacson stepped in and attempted to absorb the blame, rather than deflecting or lying about it. A prerequisite to understanding the gospel is acknowledging that you’re screwed up. Most of our kids don’t get the Gospel. So seeing Jacson with a contrite heart gives Darwing and the rest of our staff hope that perhaps Kener and Jacson are on the path to one day becoming true followers of Christ!

							Alejandro is a one of our discipleship leaders from a small fishing village called Salinas Grande. But when we first met him, he was an angry kid. He was furious with his parents for abandoning him when he was 14 years old. One of our staff members, Darwing, took him to El Limonal (our flagship community) a couple of times. Alejandro was amazed at how effective the program was at creating real life change in kids. Before he became a leader in the program, he hadn’t considered that God could use him to further the gospel. He’s realized through this process that he and the other guys are discovering the love of God and a brotherly love for each other. Alejandro says that the Salinas discipleship team is his family, and he feels like love is everywhere.

							In March of 2016, Global Hope India held its first small business training. Over 30 pastors completed the course, and so far 10 have received funding to start a small business. The projects vary from goat farms, fish farms, and dairies, to grocery stores and welding shops.
						</p>
						<p>
							Each of the pastors were struggling to provide for their family. Since they have started their business, they have been able to sustain both their ministry and household – even in some cases employing some of the villagers they serve.

							Pastor Tandi is the pastor of a church in a small village in rural Orissa. The people of the village are very poor, and the church is unable to financially support the pastor. Earlier this year, Pastor Tandi completed the Global Hope India small business training program and received a micro loan to start a goat farm.
						</p>
						<p>	
							The pastor has already had a profitable season and is able to support his family. He employees one of the local men to tend the flock, which allows him to continue to work as a pastor. As his business grows, he plans to replay the loan so that another pastor can receive the same blessing.
